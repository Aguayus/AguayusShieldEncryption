# AguayusShieldEncryption
- A process to obfuscate the result of an encryption, to protect of brute force.
- Aguayus Shield Encryption modify the output of encryption process like AES or RSA, that means that the Key CAN NOT BE RECOVERED BY BRUTE FORCE
- Aguayus Shield Encryption has random output length that means that cannot be predictable
- Aguayus Shield Encryption is not based on maths because the maths is the way to calculate the key
