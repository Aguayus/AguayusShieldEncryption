# Aguayus Shield Encryption
- A process to obfuscate the result of an encryption, to protect of brute force.
- Aguayus Shield Encryption modify the output of encryption process like AES or RSA, that means that the Key CAN NOT BE RECOVERED BY BRUTE FORCE
- Aguayus Shield Encryption has random output length that means that cannot be predictable
- Aguayus Shield Encryption is not based on maths because the maths is the way to calculate the key

## Context 
 I am a simple student that I am investigating about how I can protect the actual encryptation systems likes AES or RSA to avoid that the Key used for encryption will be obtained by Brute Force.
 
 I know that the output looks like Base64 but if you decoded, you discovered that looks like base64 but is not a real base64.
 
 Heres is the

 Please try the challenge that I offer in the Api. 
 For suggestions an Ideas please create an Issue.
